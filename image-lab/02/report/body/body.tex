\subsection{Something something discrete 1D convolutions}

\subsubsection{Compute some discrete convolution}
The given ``16 pixel wide image`` is actually 17 pixels wide.
$6+5+6 = 17$.
It's okay.
Don't sweat it.

Table~\ref{tab:11a} was produced using the partial filter method for the two first and last pixels in the image.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The discrete convolution of the given 5px wide filter and 17px wide image.}
\label{tab:11a}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{Do I see the need for any padding in the example?}
Nope!
If we pad the edges with zeroes the result is the same.
Padding with anything other than zeroes changes the result in a way that isn't representative of the original image with the given filter applied.

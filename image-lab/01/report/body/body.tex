\section{Matlab}
I didn't install Matlab.
Couldn't figure out how to do it on my linux workstation.

Sure I could've reconfigured the permissions myself, but installing Octave seemed like less of a hassle at that point.

This is my exercise book.
I've no idea how many like it exist.
But as I have previously stated, this one is mine.

freeGLUT
	comes with hello_opengl.zip

GLM
	just add the header files to the project
	but where do I get the header files? let's not think about that right now.

# can I compile the project straight away?
Yes and no. It doesn't abort compilation, but it does complain about "ERROR GLUT not found!"

Do I need to include both .h and .cpp if the .cpp includes the .h?

Even after replacing glut-include with freeglut it complains about glut not being found.
oh, I have to download the lib myself?
I have to compile it myself as well. Hrm.

# Installing freeglut
Tried following the instructions in readme.mac, didn't work.
Googled and found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19648087/installing-freeglut-on-os-x-mavericks
which led me to http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/OpenGL/01_hello_opengl/mac/index.php
I need xquartz installed, which I already have: XQuartz 2.7.6 (xorg-server 1.14.6)

followed lazyfoo's guide and also the comment by Herk in the stackoverflow post.
It didn't give me any weird compile errors.
Can I just include freeglut.h in the project now?
right I was going to try and compile it.
It still complains about not finding glut, lol.
I've no idea if it works as the tutorial doesn't describe a successful compilation.


# PART 1 -- what main.cpp does
Let's start with the main function.
By the looks of it, I'd wager it performs some glut-related initialization based on whatever arguments the main function is given.
glutInitDisplayMode probably does some display initialization with GLUT_RGBA bitwised OR'd with GLUT_SINGLE as its argument.

The next three calls configure the window and set its initial position, size and title.
The title-setting call's main function is possibly creating the window -- actually making it appear -- but with the argument passed it probably has the side-effect of setting the window's title.
Or the argument might be for something completely different.

The draw function is set as the drawing function for the display and then the main loop of glut is set in motion.

The draw function draws a black background.

OS X 10.9.4 (13E28)
MacBookPro11,1

cmake-3.0.0
freeglut-2.8.1


freeGLUT
	comes with hello_opengl.zip

GLM
	just add the header files to the project
	but where do I get the header files? let's not think about that right now.

# can I compile the project straight away?
Yes and no. It doesn't abort compilation, but it does complain about "ERROR GLUT not found!"

Do I need to include both .h and .cpp if the .cpp includes the .h?

Even after replacing glut-include with freeglut it complains about glut not being found.
oh, I have to download the lib myself?
I have to compile it myself as well. Hrm.

# Installing freeglut
Tried following the instructions in readme.mac, didn't work.
Googled and found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19648087/installing-freeglut-on-os-x-mavericks
which led me to http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/OpenGL/01_hello_opengl/mac/index.php
I need xquartz installed, which I already have: XQuartz 2.7.6 (xorg-server 1.14.6)

followed lazyfoo's guide and also the comment by Herk in the stackoverflow post.
It didn't give me any weird compile errors.
Can I just include freeglut.h in the project now?

# Stuff to do:

1. Plot a cube of any color using 12 triangles.

2. In RS1, rotate the cube in y.

3. In RS2, rotate the cube in z at speed v1 and in y at speed v2 where v1 != v2.

4. In RS3, copy RS2 and also rotate in z at v3 != v1.

5. In RS4, translate the cube back and forth through z.

6. In RS5, translate the cube back and forth in x and rotate it in x, y and z.

# Doing stuff
We start out with a triangle.

What happens if I add another glDrawArrays() in RS1?
Nothing, apparently. What's annoying is that they don't really explain how the new pipeline works.

Oh hey, is VBO a Vertex Buffer Object?
Is what I am supposed to do the exact same thing as described here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-4-a-colored-cube/ ?

# Stuff to do:

1. Plot a cube of any color using 12 triangles.

2. In RS1, rotate the cube in y.

3. In RS2, rotate the cube in z at speed v1 and in y at speed v2 where v1 != v2.

4. In RS3, copy RS2 and also rotate in z at v3 != v1.

5. In RS4, translate the cube back and forth through z.

6. In RS5, translate the cube back and forth in x and rotate it in x, y and z.

# Doing stuff
We start out with a triangle.

What happens if I add another glDrawArrays() in RS1?
Nothing, apparently. What's annoying is that they don't really explain how the new pipeline works.

Oh hey, is VBO a Vertex Buffer Object?
Is what I am supposed to do the exact same thing as described here http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-4-a-colored-cube/ ?

Right there's some other stuff I need to include in the report as well:
In scene 2, change the values of the projection matrix so you can understand what its components' roles are.
    As the FOV decreases the triangle appears larger and closer, and as it increases the triangle seems to become smaller.
    Up to a certain point, whereupon the face of the triangle covers the entire frame or becomes smaller than a pixel, respectively.

    Changing the display range changes the depth of the projection box/convex shape/whatever.
    Its base is at wherever the camera is, which in this case is at the coordinates defined by the first vec3-argument to the `lookAt-function` used to define the Camera/View matrix.

In scene 3, read online documentation about orthogonal projection and change some values and answer "What does each value represent?"
    glm::ortho eh?
    The first two pairs of arguments define the size of the projection plane: The pairs are points on the x-axis and y-axis respectively.
    The last two arguments are optional (but we need either both or none) and define near and far z-values.
    I'm not sure what that last bit means, exactly.

Okay let's draw a fukken cube!
